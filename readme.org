* About

This is a simple repository meant to test out new ~asv~ and ~asv_runner~
features.

#+begin_src bash
asv run -b params_decorator
#+end_src

** Usage
Wouldn't recommend it, but the current local development is to verbatim replace
the ~asv_runner~ package in the generated environment:
#+begin_src bash
asv run
# Watch it fail, now delete the folder within the environment
rm -rf $HOME/QS/tests/Python/asv_experiments/.asv/env/2aee9b0c145a46b4d60c834802667a21/lib/python3.9/site-packages/asv_runner/
# .. and copy the local variant
cp -r $HOME/QS/asv_runner/asv_runner $HOME/QS/tests/Python/asv_experiments/.asv/env/2aee9b0c145a46b4d60c834802667a21/lib/python3.9/site-packages/asv_runner/
#+end_src
